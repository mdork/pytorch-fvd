# pytorch-fvd

Simple repo which uses the I3D model from https://github.com/hassony2/kinetics_i3d_pytorch to compute a preliminary score in PyTorch. Computing the original FVD (tensorflow) during training Pytorch is very complicated and this code could be used for logging. Still the original FVD score has to be determined for a obtaining a final measure.The correlation between the original and the here used FVD score is reflected by a pearson coeff of 0.99. REPO IN PROGRESS

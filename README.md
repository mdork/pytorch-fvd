# pytorch-fvd

Simple repo which uses the I3D model from XY to combine a preliminary in PyTorch. Computing the original FVD (tensorflow) during training Pytorch is very painful and this code could be used for logging. The correlation between the original and the here used FVD score is reflected by a pearson coeff of 0.99. REPO IN PROGRESS
